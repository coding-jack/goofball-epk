      About the Band
    </h3>
    <div class="">
      <p>Goofball Bucket is a Denver-based band blending elements of funk, bluegrass, and rock n’ roll.</p>
      <p>Featuring “Uncle” Jesse Branum, Jackson “Choir Master” Kaufman, Steve “Dirty” Sanchez, and Jeff “El Jefe” Warnock, the group’s driving rhythm section anchors the lead mandolin and electric guitar.</p>
      <p>The Bucket’s groovy jams, sweet three-part harmonies, catchy hooks, and psychedelic instrumental sections will keep you goofin’ all night.</p>
      <p>These Goofballs may come across jokingly, but they are very serious about what they do and where they are going.  The band has big plans to play beyond the brewerys and bars, and to penetrate the club and mid sized venue scene as soon as shows are kicking back in.</p>
