      About the Band
    </h3>
    <div class="">
      <p>What started as a few joke songs just for fun has morphed into a full-fledged, 5-piece, eclectic powerhouse.  Shwarma has a history spanning back 4 years with revolving lineups and live show techniques.  Lead by Jackson and Pieter, who both write, record and produce the music themselves, the band spans many different genres and sounds, which the duo agree they could not live without.</p>
      <p>Their musical influences pour into the sound to blend a briny mixture of psychedelic, latin, funk, jazz, groove, grunge and sludge among other feels and textures. The band performed initially as a duo playing along to backing tracks, but later brought in drums, keys then bass to embrace the full band sound and let go of a computerized live performance.</p>
      <p>Shwarma and it's members have played around town at venues like the Marquis Theater, Summit Moon Room, Globe Hall, Larimer Lounge, Lost Lake, hi-dive, Cervantes and many more. After the release of 'Emily's Aparments' in May, the band is set on hitting the local live scene hard and booking gigs all along the front range all summer and into next year.</p>
      <p>The band has one EP and will have two full lengths after the drop of Emily's Aparments.</p>
